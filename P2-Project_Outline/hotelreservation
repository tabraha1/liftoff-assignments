Overview
Hotel Reservation System - Create a reservation system which books hotel rooms for a fictional hotel. 
It charges various rates for particular sections of the hotel. Example, hotel rooms that have penthouse suites cost more. 
Keep track of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled.

I hope to build this as a mobile, responsive website. I'll design and build a REST API using Java and Spring Boot. 
Then build a responsive frontend using AngularJS 2 and Twitter Bootstrap. Finally test each end-point using Postman.

Features
A user will be able to search for available rooms based on a check-in and check-out date.
User will be able to create a reservation, update a reservation, and delete a reservation.

Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
AngularJS 2
SASS
Twitter Bootstrap
Postman

What I'll Have to Learn
I'll learn frontend UX design and technologies such as SASS, Javascript, AngularJS and also a backend REST API using Spring
Boot and Postman. 
The challenge will be to bring all these technologies together to make a stylish, and functional website.
